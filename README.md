# Big Data Research Project 2024

This project uses Docker to create a cluster of Hadoop HDFS and Spark nodes to store and process a simple CSV comprised of minority health data. 

The results include a correlation heatmap of health factors and outcomes for African American communities as well as a geospatial heatmap of the prevalence of health outcomes in African American communities throughout the country.
